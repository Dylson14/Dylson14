### Hi there üëã

My name is Dylson Oliveira, I'm a dilligent and enthusiastic Full-Stack Web Developer currently working as a Full-Stack Teaching Assistant at Edx. 
By degree, I'm a mechanical engineer, and yet somewhere along the way I found Web Development, and I've been enjoying it ever since. Now I want to take my skills to the next level, so I'm seeking an opportunity to work in Web Development on exciting projects alongside a great team!

I thrive in environments where personal and development is embraced, with a focus on equal opportunities as well as a place that fosters creativity and determination, allowing me to push myself and perform the best way I can.

## Things about me outside of coding! üéâ
* I like making YouTube videos about travel and remote work! üìÄ
* I like to go on nature hikes, and I use the All-Trails app to find nice trails! üèïÔ∏è 
* I've been getting into more fitness activities, the latest cool fitness activity I did was bouldering! üßóüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
